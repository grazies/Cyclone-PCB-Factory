Then run a clone:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tgit clone git://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory.git\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will download the latest sources into a directory named 'Cyclone-PCB-Factory'.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent stable version: 2.1  \r\n--  \r\n\r\n**Recent news:**\r\n* [Kris Wauters](http://www.digitalplayground.be/) has designed [a set of feet](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131591) that raise up the machine and allow to place the electronics underneath. He has also made a [Z endstop support](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1131591). Check out his beautiful build in [his blog](http://www.digitalplayground.be/?p=3255).\r\n* Introductory tutorial: [**Milling a bowl with bCNC**](https://github.com/carlosgs/grblForCyclone/wiki/2%29-Hello-World!-Mill-a-bowl-with-bCNC) (**implemented support for GRBL firmware in RAMPS and Sanguinololu** 3D printer electronics. GRBL is better for CNCs than Marlin).\r\n* Released [**Cyclone XL (beta)**](Output_files/Cyclone_XL) with a milling area of **500x250mm**.\r\n* BQ additions have been re-incorporated into the main parametric design (zip-ties in the Y carriage linear bearing holders, longer Z motor gear, same orientation for the Y rod idlers).\r\n* If you use RAMPS, you may want to try this [GRBL mod](https://github.com/carlosgs/grblForCyclone), it is better than Marlin. Control it with the [bCNC](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC) graphical interface.\r\n* Z carriage modified for Dremel 3000 by [Nicolas Arias](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/mfZC0KEy7gw/TaSLBKO9QJUJ) and [Marcos Bladauskas](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/WJLWC5qAm-w/70eSQ2DBCAAJ) ([download it here](Output_files/Zcarriages)).\r\n* Check out the [Arduino CNC shield housing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929981) by Oliver Kreuzenbeck (Helicon).\r\n* [Source code improvements (better parameterization, M4 screw version)](https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/pull/33) by [Arne Durr (D-Byte)](https://github.com/D-Byte).\r\n* An [**aluminium spindle holder**](https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/pull/40) by [Marc Muntada (quikshot)](https://github.com/quikshot) ([download it here](Output_files/Zcarriages)).\r\n* There is also [a folder](bq_additions) with the version by [Pedro de Oro](https://github.com/PedroDeOro) and [Luis Díaz](http://diwo.bq.com/author/ldiaz/) from **bq**, with some additions that simplify the assembly process (these have already been merged into the main branch).\r\n* Daniel Evrard has [assembled Cyclone in Sketchup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/1TpFxE7avRo/EBSx7ouy9GwJ) which can be very useful as a template.\r\n* Thanks must also go to [ve3sjk](https://github.com/ve3sjk), [joco-nz](https://github.com/joco-nz), Aisflow, Yiannis Mandravellos, Samuel Kranz and [yOPERO](https://github.com/yOPERO) for their constructive discussions and continuous support.\r\n* If your printer is too small to print the main frames of the machine, take a look at the [**shorter version of the frames**](Output_files/ShorterVersion) (thanks [Burt Bicksler!!](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cyclone-pcb-factory/ue6NiWs713w/A7_4h4Ynf54J)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Cyclone PCB Factory V2.0 was developed in the department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)**  \r\n**V2.0** addressed all the issues from the original design, and implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others:  \r\n\r\n* More robust design with tougher parts:\r\n * Better holders for the linear bearings (vibration made them slide away)\r\n * Reinforced nut/screw holders\r\n* Anti-backlash mechanisms\r\n* Improved gears with smoother edges\r\n* Protective cover for the gears\r\n* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner\r\n* Better scalability (parameterized design)\r\n* Using a [Dremel 200](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/Pages/ToolDetail.aspx?pid=200+Series) as the spindle motor\r\n* Integrated endstop holders\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"Media/Cyclone_v2.0.png\" width=\"80%\">\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Render of Cyclone v2.0</i></div>\r\n</p>  \r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"Media/Cyclone_v2.0.gif\" width=\"60%\">\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The new design tries to be more parameterized</i></div>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nVideos  \r\n--  \r\n- October 2015.

Also, **Diego Viejo**'s machine was of great inspiration for the Z axis (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113930344830086538817/albums/5868944432651911713?authkey=CLDJgdehlN773gE>) **Thank you all!!**  \r\n- This design woudn't have been possible without the encouragement of the **Panda CNC community** (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>)  \r\n- Also, thanks to **Juan González-Gómez (Obijuan <http://iearobotics.com>)** for naming the machine Cyclone :)  \r\n\r\nDerived from / we have used / inspirational  \r\n--\r\n- \"Linear actuator concept for CNC machines\" by **Carlosgs** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45103>)  \r\n- \"Obiscad library\" by **Obijuan** (<https://github.com/Obijuan/obiscad>)  \r\n- \"Minimal footprint friction-fit LM8UU holder\" by **thantik** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23041>)  \r\n- \"Spindle mount for ShapeOko\" by **Misan** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26740>)  \r\n- \"Carro Z para Cyclone CNC mill intended for PCB\" by **Quim** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:80718>)  \r\n- \"Write.scad (and DXF fonts)\" by **HarlanDMii** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193>)  \r\n- \"PCB Machining Vise\" by **Forgetful_Guy** (<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:63578>)  \r\n\r\nCredit for the ideas used  \r\n--  \r\nThe origin of Cyclone took place while I (carlosgs) was inside the **Panda CNC** community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>). This is from December 2012 to mid-February 2013.  \r\nHere is the credit for the ideas that were used:  \r\n\r\n* _Let's design a 3D-printable CNC for PCB milling, it will be named Panda:_ **Guillermo Welch** (mid-December, via Google Talk)  \r\n* _X carriage rod distribution:_ **César Augusto Fernández Cano** claims Cyclone's X axis is a derivate of his concept: <https://plus.google.com/u/0/111421387442355054591/posts/QrfYtEuZBaj>  \r\n* _100x160mm workspace:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/workplace_size.png>  \r\n* _Using gears to drive the X-Y axes:_ **Guillermo Welch** <https://plus.google.com/u/0/101232926728463427403/posts/QjZGNcWcgGg>  \r\n* _Regarding the woodbase:_ **Guillermo Welch** always contemplated the possibility of attaching the machine (optionally) to a woodbase. I decided to use the base as a main structural part instead. See <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/woodbase.png> (screenshot from <https://plus.google.com/u/0/113437723819360223498/posts/8LDCSSVWqCS>)  \r\n* _List of CNC endmill types:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/cnc_endmill_types.png>  \r\n\r\nPlease note I have taken screenshots of the post that are on the closed G+ Panda community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116318709564872967169>).
